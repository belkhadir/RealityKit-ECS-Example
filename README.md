# RealityKit ECS Example

An example project that demonstrates how to build an **immersive RealityKit scene** using the **Entity-Component-System (ECS)** architecture in visionOS.

This project accompanies the tutorial published on **[SwiftOrbit.io](https://swiftorbit.io/realitykit-ecs-immersive-scene/)**

## Overview

This example shows how to:
- Create custom **components** and **systems** in RealityKit.
- Organize your scene with a clean **ECS-based structure**.
- Animate 3D entities (a floating brick) inside an immersive space.
- Register and manage systems in `AppModel`.
